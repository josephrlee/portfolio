      <description>&lt;p&gt;Remember a Pet is a personalized pet sympathy card ordering service. Its primary audience is veterinary clinics. I was responsible for the visual design and front end development of the site. I worked with a software engineer and we built the site on top of Shopify. It was launched in March of 2016 and I&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity to work on and watch it grow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Seattle Urban Academy is a positive, educational community where students overcome risks to graduate and succeed in life. They were in need of a new website to appeal to prospective students and donors and move away from the old siteâ€™s negative voice and visuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The redesign focused on engaging prospective students and donors with positive imagery and messaging that showcased the SUA family. I simplified the navigation and integrated a digital volunteer solution that connects with Salesforce. I was also responsible for the front-end development and integration with Forestry.io, a static git-based CMS.&lt;/p&gt;

Last holiday season, I migrated the Global Gift Guide website to Shopify and was responsible for the design and front-end development of the new site.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2013, I led the redesign of &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldconcern.org/&quot; title=&quot;Visit the Site&quot;&gt;World Concern&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; website with a small but talented team consisting of a developer and a writer. We transformed the static website into a user-friendly, responsive experience, helping to solidify World Concern&amp;rsquo;s reputation as a trustworthy nonprofit. One of my primary objectives was to use rich imagery to help convey the story of World Concern and its beneficiaries. By telling visually compelling stories of transformation, the redesign helped to increase fundraising revenue by 14% and conversion rates by 123% year over year. Following the redesign, I&amp;rsquo;ve also been responsible for maintaining and upgrading the website for each new fundraising campaign. In 2017, I implemented a new donation platform that integrated with Salesforce.&lt;/p&gt;
